      <question>Why is the documentation generated with the plugin empty?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The main reason for empty documentation is the fact that Modules were not detected by Pousse-Café.
          Without a containing Module, no Aggregate nor service nor process will be shown.
        </p>

        <p>
          A module is described by an interface extending the <code>Module</code> interface. All components located
          in the same package as this interface or a sub-package is considered as part of the module.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another deprecated method is to use a <code>package-info.java</code> in the Module's base package.
          The package javadoc must contain the <code>@module</code> tag which defines the name of the Module.
        </p>

        <p>
          All components (including the module's interface or <code>package-info.java</code> file) must be in the base
          package configured for <a href="./generate-doc-mojo.html">generate-doc</a> goal.
        </p>

        <p>When your Module is defined in another Maven project, do not forget to put a source dependency on
            that project as Pousse-Café uses static source code analysis to generate the documentation.
